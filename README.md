# Linguarcana
**Esoteric programming language with a text in Latin as the code.**  
The first line of Linguarcana code shall start with *de* followed by the program's name or short desctription as the header. Here the example file's header:  
> De Primo Exemplo

The rest of the code is divided in **sections** each starting with *Mense* followed by the name of the month. The order in which the sections are compiled isn't determined by their order, but by the months' order.  
To move the pointer forward use **Incedo I miliario** (or more using **miliariis**) and same with **Retrocedo** to move it backwards.  
To increase the cell use **Incedo I legione** ( or more using **legionibus**) and same with **Retrocedo** to decrease it.  
Use **Memento mori** to stop the program; **Gallia est omnis divisa in partes I** to divide the cell by a number; **Hic est** to copy the cell into a variable and store it; **illo numero** to reference anything stored in the variable; **Verba volant, scripta manent** to convert the current cell to a character; **Non loqui sed facere** to convert it back to a number.  
Numbers are (obviously) expressed with roman numerals.
