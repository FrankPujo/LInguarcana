# LInguarcana
**Esoteric programming language with a text in Latin as the code.**  
The first line of Linguarcana code shall start with *de* followed by the program's name or short desctription as the header. Here the example file's header:  
> De Primo Exemplo

The rest of the code is divided in **sections** each starting with *Mense* followed by the name of the month. The order in which the sections are compiled isn't determined by their order, but by the months' order.  
Numbers are (obviously) expressed with roman numerals.
